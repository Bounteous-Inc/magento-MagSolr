# Apache Solr PHP client
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/reprovinci/solr-php-client.png)](https://travis-ci.org/reprovinci/solr-php-client)

A PHP library for indexing and searching documents within an [Apache Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/)
installation.

This client library was forked from Donovan JimÃ©nez' Google Code project: http://groups.google.com/group/php-solr-client  
Before that, it was hosted in Solr's issue tracker: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-341

## What is Apache Solr?
> Solr is an open source enterprise search server based on the Lucene Java search library, with XML/HTTP
  and JSON APIs, hit highlighting, faceted search, caching, replication, a web administration interface
  and many more features. It runs in a Java servlet container such as Tomcat.
> For more information about Solr, please see the [Solr Web Page](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/). The
  project's [Wiki](http://wiki.apache.org/solr/) is the de facto starting point for information on how
  to install and configure Solr for your individual needs.

## Features
 * Quering, deleting, optimizing.
 * Support for both Solr 3 and Solr 4 through compatibility layers.
 * Support for soft commit with Solr 4.
